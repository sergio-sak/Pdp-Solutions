Recursion From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A visual form of recursion known as the Droste effect. Recursion, in mathematics and computer science, is a method of defining functions in which the function being defined is applied within its own definition; specifically it is defining an infinite statement using finite components. The term is also used more generally to describe a process of repeating objects in a self-similar way. For instance, when the surfaces of two mirrors are exactly parallel with. Formal definitions of recursion In mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods defined by a simple base case (or cases) and rules to reduce all other cases toward the base case. For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors: One's parents are one's ancestors (base case). The parents of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (recursion step).Recursion From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A visual form of recursion known as the Droste effect.

Recursion, in mathematics and computer science, is a method of defining functions in which the function being defined is applied within its own definition; specifically it is defining an infinite statement using finite components. The term is also used more generally to describe a process of repeating objects in a self-similar way. For instance, when the surfaces of two mirrors are exactly parallel with. Formal definitions of recursion In mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods defined by a simple base case (or cases) and rules to reduce all other cases toward the base case.
