## About
Welcome to my PDP Solutions Repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains my solutions for the **Panellinios Diagwnismos Plhroforikhs (PDP: pdp.gr)**. These solutions are the result of my hard work and dedication. They are not just lines of code; they represent my understanding and problem-solving skills.

## Notice
ðŸ›‘ **Important:** These solutions are my intellectual property. While I've decided to share them here, please respect the effort I've put into them. Feel free to **view** and **learn** from them, but **do not** copy, steal, or reuse them without my permission.

## How to Use
If you're struggling with your PDP preparations, you can use these solutions as a **reference** or for **inspiration**. However, it's crucial to try solving the problems yourself first. Learning and growth come from challenges and overcoming them.

## Repository Structure
- Each problem solution is organized in its own directory.
- Clear and concise code along with helpful comments(Some times).
- Feel free to explore and learn!
